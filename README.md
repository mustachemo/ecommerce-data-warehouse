# E-Commerce Data Warehouse

## Description

This project aims to build a PostgreSQL-based data warehouse for analyzing e-commerce activities. Utilizing the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terencicp/e-commerce-dataset-by-olist-as-an-sqlite-database/data), the project will demonstrate the implementation of a star schema for efficient data analysis and reporting in an e-commerce context.

## Goals

- To design and implement a data warehouse using PostgreSQL.
- To practice data warehousing concepts such as the star schema.
- To develop ETL processes for data cleaning, transformation, and loading.
- To write complex SQL queries for analytical purposes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [E-Commerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data), which contains transactions from an online retail platform. It includes details such as invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains a sample of the dataset.
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts for creating the database schema and other related queries.
- `etl/`: Contains scripts for the ETL process.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation related to the project, including schema designs and project proposal.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage.

## Schema Design

The schema design will be detailed here, including diagrams and descriptions of the fact and dimension tables that comprise the star schema.

## Setup Instructions

Detailed instructions on how to set up and run this project will be provided here, including environment setup, database creation, and running ETL scripts.

## Usage

Instructions on how to execute the SQL queries and ETL scripts, including examples, will be provided here to demonstrate the data analysis capabilities of the warehouse.
